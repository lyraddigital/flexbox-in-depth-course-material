## Course Material Structure

### Tutorial Lectures

Folders **Lecture 4** to **Lecture 19** contains a before and after folder to indicate the code before the video started, and after it's ended. Use the before folder if you wish to follow along. Otherwise you can just check out the after folder.

### Layout Lectures

Folders **Lecture 20** to **Lecture 32** also contains a before and after folder. The before folder like with the tutorials contains the layout at the start of the video, and the after folder contains the layout after the Flexbox changes have been made.

On top of this each lecture may contain an "other-options" folder if in the video I show alternative ways the layout was achieved before Flexbox.

### Chat Application Example Lectures

Folders **Lecture 33** to **Lecture 48** contains all resources needed to help you build out the Chat application.

The **Lecture 33** folder contains the application starting files as well as the final output after all lectures have been completed.

Folders **Lecture 34** to **Lecture 48** contains all the snippets necessary to follow along with the videos. Keep in mind that this is optional, as you can also install the Visual Studio Code Extension for this course.

See the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lyrad-digital.ld-fc-snippets) for information on how to download.
